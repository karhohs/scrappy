**S**ony **C**amera **R**emote **AP**i **PY**thon, a python wrapper for communicating with Sony cameras.

The [Sony API](https://developer.sony.com/develop/cameras/) for cameras uses http and json standards for communication. *scrappy* provides a python wrapper around the Sony API, so Sony cameras can be seemlessly integrated into Python projects.
